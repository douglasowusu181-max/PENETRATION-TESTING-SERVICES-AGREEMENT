This repository contains the primary deliverable for an individual assignment focusing on the foundational legal and ethical component of cybersecurity engagements: the Penetration Testing Services Agreement and Statement of Work (SOW).

Project Objective

To draft a comprehensive, professional, and industry-standard Penetration Testing Agreement between myself and ParoCyber Ltd.

Purpose of the Agreement

The Penetration Testing Agreement serves as the formal Rules of Engagement. It is a critical document that must be finalized and signed before any testing activity begins. Its primary goals are to:

Legal Authorization: Provide explicit, written permission to conduct simulated attacks, preventing legal liability for the Pentester.

Define Scope: Clearly delineate the In-Scope Items (the systems authorized for testing) and the Out-of-Scope Activities (prohibited actions like DoS or social engineering).

Ensure Confidentiality: Protect all proprietary client information and the sensitive security findings.

Establish Deliverables: Define the professional reporting standards, including the use of CVSS v3.1 for severity ratings and providing actionable remediation steps.
